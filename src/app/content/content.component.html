        <h3>Back-End Programming</h3>
        <p>
          Before learning design, I was mainly a programmer. I had made some games with java years before
          learning web development. Now, I can code in Javascript and Angular 2. I found this is what I'm
          best at. Vist my Github for various other small projects.

        <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
        <p>
            I'm proud of my humble start. This was the first outline for my portfolio. A lot has changed
            since then. I can now make reponsive web pages that can adapt for anything. From T.V's to small phones.
            My designs can change for better use. Vist my Github for various other small projects.

        <h3>Front End Apps</h3>
        <p>
            As previously stated. I know Angular 2+, this can be used to create the front-end for apps.
            This is just a quick mockup for a recipebook. Vist my Github for various other small projects.
